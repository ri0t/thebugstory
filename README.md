# thebugstory
This is a short story about a bug.

# Rules

This story telling mechanism is work in progress. I may add, remove or change rules as i see fit.

1. New characters must be properly introduced
2. One file per character (usually)
3. Commit message should describe scene interaction and maybe some introduction etc
4. ?????
5. PROFIT!

# Why?

Because - as someone said - we can!

Also:

## Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology: prov.

    “There is always one more bug.”
    
### Riot's corollary

    “Where there is a feature, there is always a bug.”
